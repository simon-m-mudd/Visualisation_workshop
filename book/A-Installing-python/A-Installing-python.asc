=== Setting up Python

This is a quick guide. There are a lot of options for setting up python but this is our preferred setup. 

. The best way to install python is http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html[miniconda]. We will use **Python 2.7**, so use the Python 2.7 installer.  http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html[Miniconda] works on all popular operating systems.

. Once you have installed that, you can go into a powershell (windows) or terminal (MacOS and Linux) and get the other stuff you need:
+
[source,consol]
----
  PS> conda install scipy
  PS> conda install matplotlib
  PS> conda install pandas
  PS> conda install gdal
  PS> conda install spyder
----
+
. To run spyder you just type `spyder` at the command line.

WARNING: Spyder needs an older version of a package called *PyQt*. If spyder doesn't start correctly, run `conda install pyqt=4.10 -f`
