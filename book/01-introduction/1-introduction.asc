== Background and Motivation

One of the best way to communicate data is through visualisations (i.e., charts, plots, maps, etc). If you make beautiful plots your audience will be more likelyu to pay attention to the underlying data. A beautiful plot is also a great way to disseminate your results, especially now in the days of socuial media. 

Many plots, however, fail to communicate information well. Some of these are also ugly. Your aim should be to produce well-concieved, effective plots. This is a very brief overview of some tools you can use to do so.
